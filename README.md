## 📣 Latest News
- **[Apr 21, 2026]**: 🔥🔥🔥We have successfully extended **IGPO** to handle ultra-long-horizon Deep Research tasks (200+ turns). Based on this, we trained **DR-Venus**, a frontier 4B deep research agent for edge-scale deployment. Empowered by IGPO, the performance of DR-Venus is effectively improved on challenging benchmarks, including **BrowseComp** and **BrowseComp-ZH**. For more details, please refer to the DR-Venus technical report [![DR-Venus](https://img.shields.io/badge/DR--Venus-arXiv-b31b1b.svg?logo=arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.19859) [![DR-Venus](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗%20DR--Venus-Hugging%20Face-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2604.19859), the released models [![DR-Venus-4B-RL](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗%20DR--Venus--4B--RL-Hugging%20Face-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/DR-Venus-4B-RL), and the IGPO training codebase within the DR-Venus codebase [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-DR--Venus%2FRL-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/inclusionAI/DR-Venus/tree/master/RL).

## 💡 Method Overview
We introduce IGPO, a RL algorithm for fine-grained credit assignment in search agent training. By modeling agentic search turns as an incremental information acquisition process, IGPO defines rewards as the marginal gain in the policy's probability of generating the correct answer.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuoqingWang1/IGPO
cd IGPO

conda create -n igpo python=3.10
conda activate igpo

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Web Search API & Prompt Template

Edit `tools_server/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Google Search (via Serper API)
search_engine: "google"
serper_api_key: "your_serper_api_key_here"

# Or Bing Search (via Azure)
# search_engine: "bing"
# azure_bing_search_subscription_key: "your_bing_key_here"

# System prompt template is also defined in this file
# system_prompt: |-
#   ...
```

> **💡 Tip**: If you don't have access to a search API yet, you can use **mock mode** for testing:
> ```bash
> export IGPO_MOCK_SEARCH=true
> ```
> Or set `mock_mode: true` in `tools_server/config.yaml`. This will return simulated search results without actual API calls.

### 3. Prepare Data

Place your training data in the `data/` directory:
- `data/train.parquet` - Training data
- `data/dev.parquet` - Validation data
- `data/test.parquet` - Evaluation data

Data format: See the provided data for reference.

### 4. Training

> **Supported Models**: We currently support Qwen series models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct).

Edit `train.sh` to configure training parameters, then run:

```bash
bash train.sh
```

## 🧪 Resource-Constrained Smoke Test

The bundled single-GPU script reduces the original eight-GPU training recipe
to a small pipeline check. Its default mock-search mode exercises rollout,
tool calls, IGPO reward construction, and actor updates without consuming a
search API quota:

```bash
bash train_1gpu_mock.sh
```

Use a DR-Venus-compatible local Tantivy server for a small offline-search run:

```bash
bash train_1gpu_mock.sh local
```

Use the configured Serper or Bing API for a small real-search run:

```bash
bash train_1gpu_mock.sh online
```

The larger `full`, `online-full`, and `local-full` modes use 200 training rows
and 10 steps:

```bash
bash train_1gpu_mock.sh full
bash train_1gpu_mock.sh online-full
bash train_1gpu_mock.sh local-full
```

Smoke runs default to `SAVE_FREQ=-1` and use separate output directories for
each mode. Test checkpoint saving explicitly after the compute path is stable:

```bash
SAVE_FREQ=3 bash train_1gpu_mock.sh
```

Mock mode is an engineering check only. Its generated snippets do not provide
real evidence, so it cannot reproduce the paper's reported search-agent
metrics.

Before allocating RL workers, the script checks the Python stack, local model
path, smoke datasets, visible GPU count, and GPU memory. It expects one visible
80 GB GPU by default. Use `ALLOW_LOW_MEMORY_GPU=true` only for an intentional
lower-memory experiment.
